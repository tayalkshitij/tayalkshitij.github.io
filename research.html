            <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, under the supervision of <a href="https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kumar001/"> Prof. Vipin Kumar</a>. My main focus is to accelerate scientific discovery and solve real-world problems by automating the process of finding patterns and insights in data.   By using machine learning algorithms and models, I aim to identify patterns and trends in large and complex data sets that would be difficult or impossible for humans to find. Furthermore, I believe that by incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the machine learning process, I can make more accurate predictions and improve the performance of models in specific fields for e.g. hydrology, which can ultimately lead to better management and conservation of water resources. <br><br>

My PhD program provided me with a broad exposure to research that encompasses multiple disciplines, institutions, and sectors .My thesis was primarily funded by two grants from the National Science Foundation: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1934721&HistoricalAwards=false&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery"> "Knowledge Guided Machine Learning: A Framework for Accelerating Scientific Discovery" </a> and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1838159">"Advancing Deep Learning to Monitor Global Change"</a>. This opportunity allowed me to collaborate with a diverse team of faculty, students, and staff from various departments such as water science, public policy, and environmental engineering, as well as engage with community partners. <br><br>


<!--My thesis aims to develop machine learning techniques to address the challenges of generalization with training data that is noisy, heterogenous, and incomplete. The objective of this holistic approach is to promote the creation of techniques, procedures, algorithms, and systems that enhances the utilization of ML algorithms for automatic decision making. This objective stems from the growing penetration of technology and computational tools throughout society, which has led to a heightened need for responsible data science practices. Without these practices, systems intended to meet societal needs may result in unintended consequences. <br><br>-->

          <p><b>Kshitij Tayal,</b> Xiaowei Jia, Rahul Ghosh, Jared Willard, Jordan Read, Vipin Kumar<br><br>
              We proposes a novel machine learning approach called Invertibility-Aware-Long Short-Term Memory for integrating static and time-series data in deep recurrent models to improve predictions of lake temperature. The method is tested on predicting the temperature profile in the Midwestern U.S. and shows improvement in capturing data heterogeneity and outperforms baseline predictions by 12% when static features are unavailable.<br>

         We propose a novel framework called Knowledge-guided Self-Supervised Learning to extract system characteristic and showcased its applicability to predict streamflow in hydrologic basins, due to the variability of dominant processes and the presence of noise and uncertainty in existing basin characteristics. We outperforms the baseline by 16% in predicting missing characteristics, and 35% improvement in performance over the standard baseline when static characteristics are unknown.<br>

         This article proposes a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence to reduce modeling effort and ensure utility for decision-making for complex systems that have diverse and interacting processes, such as droughts and crop production.

         Several deep learning methods for phase retrieval exist, but most of them fail on realistic data without precise support information. We propose a novel method based on single-instance deep generative prior that works well on complex-valued crystal data.<br>

          <p><b>Kshitij Tayal,</b> Rahul Ghosh, Vipin Kumar<br><br>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have had success in various natural language tasks. However, DNNs require a lot of high-quality annotations, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. This study proposed methods for handling label noise in large scale text classification that can be easily incorporated into existing machine learning workflows. The study compares several noise-robust methods on three datasets and three popular classification models. The study's approach outperforms baselines by up to 10% in classification accuracy and does not require any modifications to the network.<br>

	  Short text classification is a challenging problem in natural language processing, social network analysis, and e-commerce. Popular deep learning methods are limited in their effectiveness due to the lack of structure in short text sequences. We propose a Graph-regularized Graph Convolution Network (GR-GCN) which incorporates label dependencies in the output space to improve classification results. The proposed model outperforms several baseline methods by up to 6% and is also more robust to noise in textual features.<br>

	<p><b>Kshitij Tayal</b>, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Raunak Manekar, Zhong Zhuang, Vipin Kumar, Ju Sun<br><br>
	Many physical systems have inputs that generate the same output due to intrinsic symmetries. When trying to invert these systems using end-to-end deep learning methods, it leads to difficulties as the input is mapped to multiple symmetry-related outputs. We propose a solution of breaking the symmetry of the training data and show it to be effective in improving learning performance in real data experiments.<br>

	<p>We develop a novel algorithm for aligning sequences on genome variation graphs. It avoids the expensive process and instead uses a dynamic programming formulation for gapped alignment directly on the input graph. The time complexity of the algorithm has linear dependence on the sizes of the sequence, the graph, and its feedback vertex set. <i>Journal of Computational Biology (JCB, 2019)</i> [<a href="https://cb.csail.mit.edu/cb/recomb2017/awards.html"><span class="red-text"> RECOMB Best Poster Award 2017  </span> </a>] [<a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cmb.2017.0264">paper</a>]</p>

	<p>We proposed a novel cognitive biometrics modality based on an individual's written language usage, using internet-scale blogs to create a cognitive fingerprint. The modality is based on the characteristic patterns of how individuals express their thoughts through written language, and it addresses the problems of cognitive authentication and identification. It lays the groundwork for building alternative cognitive systems, as it is easy to obtain, unobtrusive and requires no additional hardware.<i>IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS, 2017)</i> [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7556408">paper</a>]</p>
