          <p><b>Kshitij Tayal,</b> Xiaowei Jia, Rahul Ghosh, Jared Willard, Jordan Read, Vipin Kumar<br><br>
              We proposes a novel machine learning approach called Invertibility-Aware-Long Short-Term Memory for integrating static and time-series data in deep recurrent models to improve predictions of lake temperature. The method is tested on predicting the temperature profile in the Midwestern U.S. and shows improvement in capturing data heterogeneity and outperforms baseline predictions by 12% when static features are unavailable.<br>

         We propose a novel framework called Knowledge-guided Self-Supervised Learning to extract system characteristic and showcased its applicability to predict streamflow in hydrologic basins, due to the variability of dominant processes and the presence of noise and uncertainty in existing basin characteristics. We outperforms the baseline by 16% in predicting missing characteristics, and 35% improvement in performance over the standard baseline when static characteristics are unknown.<br>

          <p>Yolanda Gil et al, <b>Kshitij Tayal</b>, Vipin Kumar<br><br>
         This article proposes a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence to reduce modeling effort and ensure utility for decision-making for complex systems that have diverse and interacting processes, such as droughts and crop production. This framework includes an intelligent user interface, semantic metadata for models, and semantic representations of data to enable automated data selection and transformations.<br>

         Several deep learning methods for phase retrieval exist, but most of them fail on realistic data without precise support information. We propose a novel method based on single-instance deep generative prior that works well on complex-valued crystal data.<br>

          <p><b>Kshitij Tayal,</b> Rahul Ghosh, Vipin Kumar<br><br>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have had success in various natural language tasks. However, DNNs require a lot of high-quality annotations, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. This study proposed methods for handling label noise in large scale text classification that can be easily incorporated into existing machine learning workflows. The study compares several noise-robust methods on three datasets and three popular classification models. The study's approach outperforms baselines by up to 10% in classification accuracy and does not require any modifications to the network.<br>

	  Short text classification is a challenging problem in natural language processing, social network analysis, and e-commerce. Popular deep learning methods are limited in their effectiveness due to the lack of structure in short text sequences. We propose a Graph-regularized Graph Convolution Network (GR-GCN) which incorporates label dependencies in the output space to improve classification results. The proposed model outperforms several baseline methods by up to 6% and is also more robust to noise in textual features.<br>

	<p><b>Kshitij Tayal</b>, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Raunak Manekar, Zhong Zhuang, Vipin Kumar, Ju Sun<br><br>
	Many physical systems have inputs that generate the same output due to intrinsic symmetries. When trying to invert these systems using end-to-end deep learning methods, it leads to difficulties as the input is mapped to multiple symmetry-related outputs. We propose a solution of breaking the symmetry of the training data and show it to be effective in improving learning performance in real data experiments.<br>

	<p>We develop a novel algorithm for aligning sequences on genome variation graphs. It avoids the expensive process and instead uses a dynamic programming formulation for gapped alignment directly on the input graph. The time complexity of the algorithm has linear dependence on the sizes of the sequence, the graph, and its feedback vertex set. <i>Journal of Computational Biology (JCB, 2019)</i> [<a href="https://cb.csail.mit.edu/cb/recomb2017/awards.html"><span class="red-text"> RECOMB Best Poster Award 2017  </span> </a>] [<a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cmb.2017.0264">paper</a>]</p>

	<p>We proposed a novel cognitive biometrics modality based on an individual's written language usage, using internet-scale blogs to create a cognitive fingerprint. The modality is based on the characteristic patterns of how individuals express their thoughts through written language, and it addresses the problems of cognitive authentication and identification. It lays the groundwork for building alternative cognitive systems, as it is easy to obtain, unobtrusive and requires no additional hardware.<i>IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS, 2017)</i> [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7556408">paper</a>]</p>
